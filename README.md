# Project 3 - Portfolio VITE with JS

## Acceptance criteria

### JS:

- [x] Simulate navigation in a Single Page Application (SPA). This means you'll simulate being able to change the project route to display different content when the user clicks on a navigation link. Creating a navigation bar wherever you prefer (at the top or left side of the screen) with at least three links to different pages. ( Home, experiences, projects )
- [x] When I first load the page, the HTML content is injected, allowing me to see the portfolio owner's data (their image, name, job title, description, link to GitHub, link to LinkedIn, etc.).
- [x] When I click on the "Projects" link, a new content appears in the DOM showing a large list of projects accompanied by images that the person has worked on (they can be entirely fictional at this point). There should be at least five projects that I can click on to visit the project's website.
- [x] When I click on the "Experience" link, a new content appears in the DOM displaying a list of companies where the person has worked. Each item should include the company's title, logo, dates, description, and a list of responsibilities (which can be entirely fictional). There should be experience with at least five different companies, and I should be able to visit their websites by clicking on the respective elements.
- [x] When I click on the "Home Page" link, the initial content that I could see when first loading the page appears in the DOM, including the person's information and data.

### HTML & CSS

- [x] The page is fully responsive and displays correctly on both mobile and desktop devices.
- [x] The design features a good color scheme and is visually appealing. It draws inspiration from online portfolios such as the following: https://www.diegoliv.work (excluding page transition animations, but applying the required JavaScript behavior instead).

## Implementation:

- The project is a basic portfolio with home, about me, experience, projects and contact me pages
- It is done with VITE and vanilla JS
- I use holy grail `grid` layout for the main structure: with an header, aside for the navigation between pages and a main element.
- The web site is fully responsive
