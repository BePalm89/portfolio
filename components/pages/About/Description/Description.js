        <p>Hi! I am Claudia Palmerini, a frontend engineer based in Barcelona, Spain since 2020 ( yes, I moved during covid time ðŸ˜† ). I am a civil engineer, graduated in Bologna, Italy. But then I discovered the amazing world of programming!! I am passionate about UI/UX and Web design. I am a skilled front-end developer with Angular and React. I am a fast learner, eager to learn new things and a team worker that gets the job done. I lived in different places, like Bologna, Milano and Torino in Italy, then Ulm and Weimar in Germany, but then I found my place in Barcelona. I love travelling around the world to discover new culture and take amazing photos. I also enjoy going to the beach with my friends in summer time and training in the gym. I have two crazy cats, Simba and Slash, I love them!!</p>
